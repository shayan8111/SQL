The purpose of this lab is to introduce students to querying data from multiple tables.  Relationships are used in relational databases to reduce redundant and repetitive data, but it is necessary to reconnect these tables when extracting data and obtaining information.  Student will be able to:
produce query results containing data from multiple tables using ANSI-92 joins and demonstrate their knowledge of inner, outer and full joins.
To actively troubleshoot queries to handle potentially ambiguous fields across multiple tables through the use of aliases
Students learn to create and modify views.
